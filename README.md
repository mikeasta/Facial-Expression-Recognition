# Facial Expression Recognition 
**Model to classify facial expressions using PyTorch.**
<br>**Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahadullaha/facial-emotion-recognition-dataset (unfortunately, this is awful dataset. There are bunch of labels which are incorrect)
<br>**Stack**: Python Core, PyTorch, Torchvision, MLFlow
<br>**Results**: Developed custom CNN model. Applied optimizations like dropout, regularization, augmentation, etc. Achieved 70% accuracy. Model weights in `models`
<br> **Prediction example**:
